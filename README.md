# 📘 Micro degree: *Mastering Web Dynamics: From HTTP to Real-Time*

Discover how the web works, from its foundations to its most dynamic mechanisms. This micro-course will guide you step by step through essential concepts such as HTTP, the DOM, asynchronous requests, APIs, and WebSockets. An ideal experience for those starting in web development or looking to strengthen their foundations to confidently advance toward interactive and modern projects.

## Micro-course Content

### **Lesson 1: The Language of the Web – Understanding HTTP**
> HTTP is the protocol that governs how browsers communicate with servers. In this lesson, we will explore how this communication is structured, what it really means to “format and exchange text,” and the role of the browser as a visual translator of content.

- What is HTTP, and how does it work?
- What does it mean that HTTP has no “format”?
- Text formats accepted by the browser

### **Lesson 2: Designing the Web – Structure, Style, and Dynamism**
> A modern website combines several languages working together. This lesson analyzes the essential trio: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- Files needed to create a static site (HTML + CSS)
- What does JavaScript add to the experience?
- What formats does a dynamic website need?

### **Lesson 3: From URL to Content – How a Web Page Loads (Part 1)**
> From typing a URL to seeing a page, multiple steps occur. Here we break down that invisible journey.

- The initial request (`index.html`) and its associated resources
- HTTP headers and server responses
- HTTP statuses and browser behavior

### **Lesson 4: The DOM in Action – How the Browser Builds the Web (Part 2)**
> Once the files are received, the browser creates the DOM. Understanding it is key to dynamically manipulating pages.

- What is the DOM?
- Progressive rendering: HTML, CSS, JS
- What happens when loading scripts, styles, and images

### **Lesson 5: Beyond `load` – How to Load Content Dynamically**
> Many modern applications load data *after* displaying the interface. In this lesson, we address how this is achieved with JavaScript.

- Introduction to AJAX and the concept of “post-load”
- 22 modern ways to make requests (fetch, axios, etc.)
- Common use cases: search engines, filters, feeds

### **Lesson 6: HTTP Methods – Advanced Interaction with the Server**
> HTTP is not just about “requesting” data. It also allows sending, updating, and deleting data with other methods.

- Introduction to POST, PUT, and DELETE
- Best practices and key differences
- Forms and APIs as practical examples

### **Lesson 7: Separating Front from Back – The Power of APIs**
> Modern web separates visual content (front-end) from business logic (back-end). Here we understand how this division works.

- What is an API?
- Communication between front and back using REST
- Examples of decoupled architecture

### **Lesson 8: Real-Time on the Web – Getting Started with WebSockets**
> When you need the server to send data without waiting for a request, WebSockets come into play.

- What is a WebSocket, and how does it work?
- Differences from a REST API
- Applications: chats, online games, real-time notifications
