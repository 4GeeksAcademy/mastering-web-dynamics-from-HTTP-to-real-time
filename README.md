# Mastering Web Dynamics: From HTTP to Real-Time

This course follows the complete journey of the HTTP protocol, from the first DNS query to real-time updates with WebSockets. Designed to help beginners understand step by step how websites work.

1. **Resolving DNS:** Find the server's IP address by translating a domain name like “www.example.com” into a numerical IP address like “192.0.2.1”.

2. **Server Routing:** Direct the client's request to the correct server and specific path by interpreting the URL, like delivering an order to the right section of a store.

3. **Preparing the Response and Replying to the Client:** Process the request on the server (such as fetching data or rendering HTML) and respond to the client with codes, headers, and appropriate content.

4. **Parsing the HTML:** The browser processes the received HTML and builds the DOM as if reading a recipe to plan how the page will look.

5. **Prioritizing Resource Requests:** Load CSS, JavaScript, images, and other resources based on their importance. Learn how the browser decides what to display first.

6. **Optimizing Page Load:** Explore how the browser uses caching and other strategies to speed up loading and how this impacts development and testing.

7. **Dynamic Updates with JavaScript:** Use JavaScript to make new HTTP requests to APIs without reloading the page. Ideal for displaying new data smoothly.

8. **Debugging API Requests:** Learn to inspect and troubleshoot HTTP requests from the browser, understanding the most common methods and formats in RESTful APIs.

9. **Real-Time Updates with WebSockets:** Establish a continuous connection with the server to receive instant data, such as in live chats or notifications.
