In modern web development, not all content is delivered with the initial page load. Many applications first display the basic structure (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and then request additional content based on user interaction or real-time needs.

This approach is known as **post-load**. It is an essential practice to improve perceived speed, reduce data usage, and provide smoother and more interactive experiences.

In this lesson, you will learn:

- What post-load is and how it changed the way interfaces are built.
- What modern tools and patterns exist for making asynchronous requests.
- What types of real-world functionalities use this technique and how they work.



## What is Post-Load?

The term *post-load* refers to the practice of **loading data or content after the page has already been rendered by the browser**.

This means that when a web page loads, it only brings the basic structure. Then, using JavaScript, requests are made to the server to fetch additional information, such as search results, listings, comments, etc.

For example, when opening an online store, you might first see the general structure of the site. But when you search for a product, apply filters, or scroll, new results are fetched from the server without needing to reload the entire page. That is post-load.

This technique allows:

- Faster initial load times.
- Dynamically adapting content to user interaction.
- Optimizing data usage and browser resources.


## Modern Tools for Making Requests (the "22 Ways")

When we talk about making a request to a server, there are actually many different ways to achieve it. The choice depends on the context, project complexity, and specific goals of each situation.

Here we group the **most commonly used modern methods**, not as a list to memorize, but to provide a clear conceptual map of the current ecosystem.

### 1. Requests with `fetch()` (Native API)

- `fetch(url)`: basic GET request.
- `fetch(url, { method: 'POST' })`: POST request.
- `fetch` with `async/await`: more readable syntax.
- Using `headers`: sending tokens, JSON, etc.
- `AbortController`: canceling requests.
- `FormData`: sending files.
- `ReadableStream`: processing in chunks.

### 2. Using `axios` (External Library)

- `axios.get`, `axios.post`: simple requests.
- `axios.create(config)`: configured instances.
- Interceptors (`interceptors.request/response`): modify or control flows.
- Request cancellation (deprecated but useful in legacy apps).
- Global configuration of base URL, headers, etc.

### 3. Advanced Cases and Specific Contexts

- `XMLHttpRequest`: old technique, still present.
- `jQuery.ajax()`: used in legacy environments.
- GraphQL with `fetch` or `apollo-client`.
- Libraries like `useSWR`, `react-query`: requests with caching in React.
- `WebSockets`: real-time communication.
- `sendBeacon()`: for background stats or traces.
- `Image()`: tracking via image loading.

The key is to understand **when to use each tool**, rather than knowing them all.


## Common Post-Load Use Cases

Dynamic content is not just a UX improvement; it is a real necessity in multiple types of interfaces. Below, we analyze three of the most common cases where post-load is essential.

### Real-Time Search Engines

When the user types in a search field, they expect to see results instantly, without needing to press Enter or reload the page.

This is achieved by listening to the `input` event and making a server request every time the text changes (ideally with frequency control using debounce).

```js
input.addEventListener("input", async (e) => {
    const res = await fetch(`/api?q=${e.target.value}`);
    const data = await res.json();
    renderResults(data);
});
```

### Dynamic Filters

The user selects filters (categories, ranges, tags), and the content adapts automatically. This is used in online stores, product listings, catalogs, among others.

```js
fetch(`/api/items?category=${category}&price=${price}`)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(setResults);
```
No page reload, just DOM updates with the new data.

### Feeds and Progressive Content

In social networks or dashboards, content updates periodically or when scrolling. In these cases, techniques like infinite scroll, interval updates, or WebSockets are used.

```js
window.addEventListener("scroll", async () => {
    if (window.innerHeight + window.scrollY >= document.body.offsetHeight) {
        const res = await fetch("/api/feed?page=2");
        const data = await res.json();
        appendToDOM(data);
    }
});
```

Loading dynamic content after the `load` is no longer a technical option; it is a standard for modern applications. Understanding the concept of post-load, mastering the available tools, and recognizing its real-world applications allows you to build more efficient, faster, and user-oriented web experiences.
